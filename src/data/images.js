    story: "Crossed this store multiple times during my walks in SF. Have been inside, design of products is very refreshing and calming - gives fall vibes. Tried on jacket, perfect for the weather then left it. After 2-3 visits reluctantly bought it because I felt it's too expensive. I've never paid this much for a jacket. The store owner also knew me by then. Got a mini discount and bought it. Very dependable jacket and happy with the purchase.",
